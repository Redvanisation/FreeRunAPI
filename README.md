<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a **PROTOTYPE** of a real e-commerce that I have previously developed, it's a full-stack mobile responsive app with a **React** front-end and a **Ruby on Rails API** back-end with **AWS S3** for images' storage via **active storage**, it has a PayPal checkout integration and the cart is saved in the browser's local storage. This is the back-end repo and you could find the front-end code on [https://github.com/Redvanisation/FreeRun](https://github.com/Redvanisation/FreeRun).


### Built With

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.



### Prerequisites

* `ruby '2.6.3`
* `rails 6.0.2`



### Installation
 
1. Clone the repo and cd into it
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Redvanisation/FreeRunAPI.git

cd freerunapi
```
2. Install the gems
```sh
bundle install
```
3. Create the database, migrate and seed it
```sh
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```
4. Run the development server and start using the API on **port:3000**
```sh
rails start
```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

- Run the following command to get all the available API endpoints
```sh
rails routes
```
- Requests can be made to the sessions routes `auth/login, auth/logout` to login and create a **JWT token** which will be stored into an HTTPOnly cookie and sent back in the response and used for authentication later on, and to logout.
- The users route `auth/register` is used to register new users and doesn't require a JWT token.
- The products routes can be used to make RESTful requests in order to get the list of products and update or delete them.
- The orders routes are used to retreive the registered users' orders history and the products they have previously purchased.
- The whishlist routes are used to retreive the registered users' wishlists or to delete products from it.
